In addition to the modular functions for each processing stage of RTE seafood, frozen vegetables and RTE cantaloupe, the qraLm package contains a built-in Shiny app allowing users to interactively simulate risk assessments for different food types and contamination scenarios."

It can be saved to any directory and is ready to work once it is self-extracted. No installation is needed. It is developed for kinetic parameters estimation (inverse analysis) of the most common primary and secondary models in predictive microbiology. It is designed with user-friendly graphical interfaces to direct the users to analyse individual curves of bacterial growth or survival (primary models) and effect of temperature on growth or survival rates (secondary models). Following the tutorial, users can easily analyse the curves without programming, allowing anyone, with basic knowledge of predictive microbiology, to determine the parameters of an observed curve."

USDA IPMP-Global Fit is designed to analyse both primary and secondary models of multiple growth or survival curves at the same time (one-step) to determine the kinetic parameters. It is also a standalone software tool with user-friendly graphical interfaces. Once downloaded to a local drive (hard drive or USB), it can be self-extracted and executable. No installation is needed. It is suitable for more advanced users of predictive microbiology."

It is also a self-extractable file and can work from any local drive. No installation is needed. It is specifically developed to predict the growth of foodborne pathogens under dynamically changing temperature conditions, but it is also capable for predicting bacterial growth and survival under constant temperature conditions. It is also built with user-friendly graphical interfaces to allow users to make predictions based on a time-temperature history. All models in USDA IPMP – Dynamic Prediction have been validated in the laboratory."
